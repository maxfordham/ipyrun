Introduction  {#introduction .ListParagraph}
=============

Project Overview, Design Philosophy and Key Aspects of the Brief {#project-overview-design-philosophy-and-key-aspects-of-the-brief .ListParagraph}
----------------------------------------------------------------

Key MEP Design Strategies {#key-mep-design-strategies .ListParagraph}
-------------------------

MEP documentation {#mep-documentation .ListParagraph}
-----------------

This document "MEP Employers Requirements/Specification" (SPEC-100)
provides a project-specific description of the MEP engineering services
installation. This document forms part of the design information and
should be read in conjunction with the Main Contract Preliminaries and
all associated documents.

The MEP installations are also described by the following documents:

-   SPEC-100 -- Project specific description of the MEP installations

-   SPEC-200 -- Project preliminaries setting out the Contractor's
    responsibilities in relation to design, coordination, management and
    documentation.

-   SPEC-300 -- Reference specification setting out the required
    standards for installation, testing and workmanship for the MEP
    installations.

-   Drawings and schedules listed in Appendix A of SPEC 100

Basis of Tender and Contractor Design Responsibilities {#basis-of-tender-and-contractor-design-responsibilities .ListParagraph}
------------------------------------------------------

With the exception of the performance specified MEP installations listed
in clause 4.2 of SPEC-200, the tender documents for the MEP engineering
services include MEP design developed to RIBA Stage 4.

The contractor shall allow for the design responsibilities set out in
Section 4 of SPEC-200 within their tender price.

The contractor shall include for the provision of a complete working
installation as set out in clause 3.4 of SPEC-200.

Complete in full the pricing documents (Tender Summaries in the
following section) and return with tenders.

BREEAM Requirements {#breeam-requirements .ListParagraph}
-------------------

The contractor shall contribute to the BREEAM assessment as described by
the Main Contract preliminaries. This includes the provision of both
BREEAM evidence and BREEAM compliant installations. See the individual
work sections, BREEAM manual and BREEAM pre-assessment (or design stage
assessment) for detailed requirements.

SYSTEM DESCRIPTION {#system-description-39 .ListParagraph}
------------------

Power supplies to "Specialist Systems" (e.g. security, fire alarm, BMS
etc.) are NOT necessarily shown and the Contractor shall liaise with the
appointed Specialists to ensure all installations are provided with
suitable power supplies, as required by SPEC-200, Design Responsibility.
The tender price is deemed to have included these power supplies.

The use of non-metallic fixings/support of the containment shall not be
employed in any areas considered subject to premature collapse that
could cause an entanglement. BS 7671:2018 (IET Wiring Regulations 18th
Edition) includes a requirement that wiring systems that could collapse
shall have fire-resisting supports. Cables on top of cable tray, ladder
rack or similar, or cables installed within conduit and metallic
trunking systems would need no special consideration. Cables clipped to
walls and cables inside of plastic trunking with lids will require a
fire-resisting fixing in such a way that they will not become an
entanglement risk in an emergency. Wiring systems need to be secured to
stop cables falling if their support failed when heated. Any wiring
systems within the fabric of the building that are not liable to
premature collapse would not need to comply with this requirement.
