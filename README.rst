A generic user interface for running scripts. Data inputs to scripts are defined by standard datafiles (e.g. csv, json), and data files are generated as outputs when the script is run. A timestamped record of script execution is maintained. An ipywdiget user interface allows users to edit script input data and view outputs of script execution.
