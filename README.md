ipyrun is UI first package built on ipywidgets designed for rapidly creating an app user interface for use in a
jupyter notebook / lab or voila app. To run a script or process and generate resultant output files.
The app caches input, output and runtime data, such that the previous state of the app is available to the user when returning.

## Screenshots

The example below shows the simple example of using the `ipyrun` to create an App for plotting straight line
graphs, storing the input and output data for multiple runs. This is a useless example, but `ipyrun` can be
programmed to complete any process creating user-defined input files and output files.

## Description

A generic user interface for running processes.
Data inputs to the process are defined by standard datafiles (e.g. csv, json), and data files are generated as outputs when the script is run.
A timestamped record of script execution is maintained.
An ipywdiget user interface allows users to edit script input data and view outputs of script execution.

## User Journey to Creating an App with the DefaultAppConfig

The rationale behind ipyrun is that by following the simple process outlined below, the user does not need to think
too much about creating an interface or how to cache data, with this being templated by the ipyrun configuration.

ipyrun is "UI first",  upon which different, user-applied configurations can be attached. ipyrun ships with a
`DefaultRunConfig` that is intended for executing python scripts or packages. New users are recommended to use
this configuration, creating new configurations is an "advanced feature" that would require digging around the 
source code to ensure understand the relationships between the `config`, `actions` and `ui`.

```{note}
it is possible to set up new ipyrun configurations, that might have different execute commands. 
for example it would be great to create a `RunSnake` app for executing SnakeMake commands...
