# ipyrun

ipyrun is designed for rapidly creating a user interface (to be operated in a jupyter notebook / lab or voila app) to run a script or process and generate resultant output files.

## Use cases

A generic user interface for running scripts.
Data inputs to scripts are defined by standard datafiles (e.g. csv, json), and data files are generated as outputs when the script is run.
A timestamped record of script execution is maintained.
An ipywdiget user interface allows users to edit script input data and view outputs of script execution.
